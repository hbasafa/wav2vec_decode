# wav2vec_decode
This repo is to contain various decoding methods all in one place

# About
wav2vec2 is a great framework for speech representation which results well with respect to the dataset size. More information about this model can be found at:
  1. github: https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wav2vec 
  2. paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477

This repository ease the use of language model decoding, which is also provided in FairSeq and (soon) HuggingFace, and some facitlies like multiprocessing to help speech comunity better develop speech technology and train/evaluate their models in downstream tasks like automatic speech recognition (ASR).

# Usage
Sample codes are provided as notebooks in notebooks directory of this repo.

# Updates
1. Add ngram language model decoding using pyctcdecode

# Terms of Use
Feel free to use the codes in your research or industry projects.

# Contributions
Contributions are welcome!
